# Soberatio

![Image was drunk. Was fixed.](https://jonathantneal.github.io/soberatio/assets/sample.png#tilted)

**Soberatio** helps you find [the most reasonable aspect ratio](https://jonathantneal.github.io/soberatio/) of any given shape. For instance, a 647x357 image technically has an aspect ratio of, well, 647:357, but it’s often more useful to know that its nearest “sober” aspect ratio is actually 9:5.

By default, **Soberatio** limits aspect ratios to a maximum value of 16 on both the width or height. However, you can change this in the hash of the URL. For instance, if you [add #6:8 to the URL](https://jonathantneal.github.io/soberatio/#5:8) then the maximum width will be 6 and the maximum height will be 8. In that instance, 647x357 would now have a sober aspect ratio of 5:3.
